1. Just outputs 3 because it it goes through the for loop. And when it becomes 3 < 3 it fails to go into loop and i would just be 3.
2. 150 because 300 times .5 is 150
3. 150 because 150 times 100 divided by 100 is still 150
4. [ 50, 100, 150 ] splits all the prices in half since discount is .5 and it multipies .5 into each item in the array 
5. i is not defined because it is not in the scope
6. not defined because it is not in scope 
7. 150 because 300 times .5 is 150 
8. [ 50, 100, 150 ] splits all the prices in half since discount is .5 and it multipies .5 into each item in the array  
9. i is not defined of course for the same reaosn i said earlier. Because it is not in the scope
10. 3 since the length of the array is 3
11. [ 50, 100, 150 ] 
12.   
    a.  student.name
    b. student['Grad Year']
    c. student.greeting()
    d. student['Favorite Teacher'].name
    e. student.courseLoad[0] 

13. 
    a. 32 concatenate 3 and 2
    b. 1 string converted to number and 3-2 is 1
    c. 3 plus nothing is 3 
    d. 3null concatenate 3 + null
    e. 4 3 + 1 is 4 true=1
    f. 0 since false is 0 and nothing plus 0 is 0 
    g. 3undefined 3 concatentated to undefined
    h. Nan not a number math operater with undefined value

14. 
    a. true converts 2 to a num and is greater than 1
    b. false compare the Unicode code point value of each character 
    c. true since the values are the same
    d. false since the type are not the same
    e. false true=one and one does not equal 2
    f. true because true equals true. Boolean 2 is a true statement

15. == operator compares two values for equality after converting the operands to a common type while === operator compares two values for equality without performing any type coercion 
17. [2, 4, 6] it passes in a function as a paramater which is a callback and thus multiplies every value in the array by 2
